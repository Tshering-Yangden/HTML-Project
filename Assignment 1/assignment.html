    <h3 align="left">Royal Wedding</h3>
    <p style="background-color: rgba(200,100,50)">The ceremony was held in <big>Punakha</big>As he opened the session of parliament on Friday, 20 May 2011, the King announced his engagement to Jetsun Pema, born in <b>Thimphu on 4 June 1990</b>. They were married on 13 October <sub>2011</sub> in Punakha Dzong. The wedding was Bhutan's largest media event ever. <i>The ceremony was held in Punakha</i>, followed by formal visits to different parts of the country.<q>During the ceremony the King also received the Phoenix Crown of the Druk Gyaltsuen (Dragon Queen) from the most sacred Machhen temple of the Dzong and bestowed it on 
        <br><a name="Jetsun Pema"> Jetsun Pema</a>, formally proclaiming her Queen of the Kingdom of Bhutan.The wedding was held in traditional style with the "blessings of the guardian deities"</q> .
        <br>
        Weddings in general and royal weddings in particular are an elaborately planned ceremony - as was evident from the British royal wedding in April. The idea is that the whole country come together to be part of a day that goes down in history.

This will be the third royal wedding in the world this year. Prince William and Kate Middleton got married in London in April. While in July, Prince Albert II of Monaco is to marry his swimming champ fiancee, Charlene Wittstock.
        <br>

In contrast to the British wedding, the Bhutanese royal wedding will not be a grand affair, said Dorji Wangchuk from the royal media office in Thimphu.

<q>It’s going to be simple. It will be basically like the coronation, where we really didn’t have a large international guest list - very minimal. It’s basically His Majesty’s wishes that the occasion be kept small,</q> he said.
        <br>

The main religious ceremony will be held at the sacred Punakha Dzong. The exact date is yet to be finalized, but as with most auspicious occasions in the Buddhist country, the chief astrologer has offered three alternative dates which will now be selected through an oracle.
